# 1. Introduction

Effective and smart recommendation systems depend on the up-to-date and validated knowledge base. As we know that in every field of life, knowledge plays a vital role 
and all intelligent decisions are made based on knowledge. So knowledge should be accurate and updated. For producing and maintaining accurate knowledge, various machine
learning and evolutionary techniques are used to update and maintain the knowledge base. The experts’ interaction with knowledge base is mandatory to evolve the 
knowledge base with validated knowledge.
The Expert Driven- knowledge acquisition tool creates and maintains the knowledge using Domain Clinical Model (DCM) and Intelli-sense functionalities to facilitate the 
service curation layer for better quality of service. In Expert-driven approach, Physicians creates and maintains the knowledge through authoring environment with minimum 
intervention of knowledge engineers. For rule authoring, Knowledge Acquisition Tool is built that acquires knowledge from Physicians. The proposed system provides situation 
based indexing in rules of knowledge base. The situations in rules allow the Life-log monitor to observe the defined situations for users, whenever the alarming situations 
occurred then the system provides the right recommendation at right time.

 
## 1.1 Core Implementation

The expert driven knowledge acquisition is mainly include Two core components; The authoring environment, called Intelligent Knowlege Authoring Tool (I-KAT) and the sitution reasoner. 
The I-KAT is developed according to Spring MVC pattern as a maven project. The situation reasoner is implemented built-in to the knowledge-base as T-SQL stored-procedure.

### 1.1.1 I-KAT Core-Compnents 
The expert driven knowlege acquisition support knowledge from experts and provides reasoning based on situations occured in life-log. 
The authroing environment is developed to make ease in acquisition of knowledge from experts and support situation-based indexing to the
newly created rules. Furthermore, the enviornment is accompanied with situation-based reasoning to enable rules selection based on situations. 
Following are detailes of implementation component.

- Controllers:<br>
	The controllers provide bridge between the data models and views of the project. Currently we are handling following three controllers to handle 
	knowledge base (Rules), users of the knowledge base, and Domain Clinical Model (DCM). It contains under the package of "org.uclab.imp.cdss.cardiovascular.controller".
	- Rule Controller:
		It plays an important role in handling the knowledge base. It is responsible for persistence and fetching the Rules, Conditions of the Rules,
		Conclusions of the Rules, and Situations in a Rule. It is represented as "RulesController".
	- User Controller:
		This controller is responsible to handle the users (Physicianss), which are using the knowledge authoring tool. It provides bridge between the
		views and user's model. It is implemented as "UserController".
	- Wellness Model Controller:
		We provided the intelli-sense to the Physicianss on the rule editor to create rules using some controlled vocabulary. Domain Clinical Model (DCM) are
		using in creation of rules. Therefore, "WellnessModelController" handles the communication between views and Domain Clinical Model (DCM).
- Models:<br>
	Models is responsible for persisting and fetching the knowledge rules with corresponding conditions, conclusions, and situations from knowledge bases. The
	model contains three different packages as datamodel, dao (data access objects), and services.
	- Data Models:
		The data models are represented in different entity classes based on Rule, Conclusion, Condition, Situation, User, Domain Clinical Model (DCM), and Clinical
		Concepts Relationships. These data models are put under the package "org.uclab.imp.cdss.cardiovascular.datamodel".
	- DAO (Data Access Object):
		DAO handles the persistence and retrival of all knowledge artifacts such as rules, conditions, conclusions, situations, Clinical concepts, and users. According to
		the standard structure of data access layer, DAO contain one interface and one correspinding implementation class for each above mentioned knowledge artifacts. For
		example, RuleDAO interface and RuleDAOImpl is the correspinding implementation class to handle the rules of knowledge base. Similarly, ConditionDAO and ConditionDAOImpl
		for conditions, ConclusionDAO and ConclusionDAO for conclusions, SituationDAO and SituationDAOImpl for situations and so on. All these data access object and handlers 
		are implemented according to Hibernate framework.
	- Services:
		These are local services to handle the communication between controllers and DAO objects and its implementation. The services also contains one interface and one 
		correspinding implementation class. For example, RuleService is interface and RuleServiceImpl is its implementation. Similarly, ConditionService and ConditionServiceImpl
		is handling conditions of a rule, ConclusionService and ConclusionServiceImpl is for conclusions of a rule and so on.
- Views:<br>
	According to spring mvc pattern, views are responsible to view the user interfaces by rendering the correspinding html. The rendered html is merged with data retrived by controllers
	using particular DAO and services. In this project, we have following three view.
	- Login View:
		The login view is responsible to authenticate the authorized users (Physicians), who have the rights to access, create, and modify the rules in the knowledge base.
	- Dasboard View:
		We have implemented the dashboard view for viewing the existing rules in the knowledge base at a single glance. The dashboard show the meta information of the rules like
		rule title, specialist name, institution, rule created date, and two button for Editing and deleting the existing rules. The Physicians can also navigate to rule editor
		by clicking "Add new rule" button.
	- Rule Editor View:
		The rule editor view is the main editor for creating new rule and updating the existing rules. This editor provides saparate slot for meta information of the rule, saparate
		slot for adding multiple conditions of a particular rule, saparate slot for multiple conclusions of the rule. The rule editor also facilitates the Physicianss to select
		required conditional facts as situations. The selected situations are using by life-log monitor to find the abnormal situations of the user.
		

# 2. Getting Started
